    "text": "Data Source:\nThe dataset, sourced from TUIK, covers convicts received into prison across Turkey between 1990 and 2020. It includes information the educational status of the convicts. We chose this dataset because of its potential to unveil the connection between educational background and criminal behavior.\nOur objectives include:\nWe will understand the relationship between education and crime. By analyzing the data set, we will gain insights into how educational attainment influences incarceration. We will develop proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using R. We will learn how to import, clean, transform, and visualize data using R’s built-in functions and libraries. We enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills. We will apply their knowledge of R programming to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.\nOur preliminary plans include:\nWe will import the data set into R and perform any necessary cleaning and data preparation steps. We will visualize the data using various plots and charts to gain an initial understanding of the distribution of variables and the relationships between them. We will interpret the results of the analysis and communicate the findings in a clear and concise manner. We have two main data sources. One of them comes from https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/ web site. Thanks to this site we can contact a data base which take necessary command according to data base’s variable than turns a file which is excel format. Other one is an excel file which include information about crime types and number of convicts according to crime type. After some arrangement (cleaning, combining etc.) we collected our data in a excel file.\n\n\nHow Import Data:\nWe began the analysis by downloading our data from Tuik. We downloaded it as Excel. Later, we made a few adjustments in Excel because our data was very complicated. We have edited it in a way that is more understandable and easy to analyze. For example, we converted “Years” into rows and “Education Status” into columns. It also allowed us to see the missing data more clearly. And it turned into a way to analyze easily.\nWe began the analysis by downloading our data from Tuik. We installed the “readx1” package. Then we imported the data into R using the “read_excel” function. We converted the data frame to process our data. Our codes are as follows:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\ndata_criminals &lt;- read_excel(\"data_criminals.xlsx\")\n\n\nThen, we store our final dataset in .RData format. Our codes are as follows:\n\n\nCode\nsave(data_criminals, file = \"data_criminals.RData\")\n\nload(\"data_criminals.RData\")\n\nprint(data_criminals)\n\n\nExplicit Link to Our .RData File\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis:\nOur data set consists of 31 rows and 9 columns. Each line represents the years between 1990 and 2020. The columns give information about their educational status.\nEducational status are listed as follows:\nIlliterate, Literate but not Graduated from a School, Primary School, Primary Education, Junior High School and Vocational School at Junior High School Level, High School and Vocational School at High School Level, Higher Education and Unknown. There is no data between 1990-2002 in the primary education column. Likewise, there is no data between 1990-2028 in the unknown column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
